            These are static graphs using <a href="https://mermaid.js.org">Mermaid</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            These graphs can get messy, and there is no good way to remove nodes and such on the webpage (or I'm just
            too lazy to implement them). So, to edit it, you have to go to this repository, clone it, and edit the html
            files directly. Since this is a static HTML project, you can just run the .html files in your browser
            without setting up some server.
